## Selects and Options

### Intro

Select and option elements are commonly found on web forms, but can be confusing to work with. This app interacts with and manipulates select and option elements. JavaScript is used to log the values of select and option elements to the console, and program a select element to update a simple UI.

### Instructions

 Load the `index.html` file in Chrome and open the Chrome DevTools console.
